# PSVITA-PKGJ-DATADB
If you have issues with getting the titles from NoPayStation downloaded on PKGJ, then look no further! I have uploaded the entire PS Vita game, update, DLC, PSX and PSP game database to github for direct download. This will work straight out of the box with PKGJ!
Note: You must link to the “raw” file in your config.txt, here’s how it looks:

url_games http://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex4nder001/PSVITA-PKGJ-DATADB/master/PSV_GAMES.tsv
url_updates http://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex4nder001/PSVITA-PKGJ-DATADB/master/PSV_UPDATES.tsv
url_dlcs http://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex4nder001/PSVITA-PKGJ-DATADB/master/PSV_DLCS.tsv
url_psx_games http://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex4nder001/PSVITA-PKGJ-DATADB/master/PSX_GAMES.tsv
url_psp_games http://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex4nder001/PSVITA-PKGJ-DATADB/master/PSP_GAMES.tsv

I do not plan to update this unless either PKGJ adds support for more types of downloadable software.
This is mainly for personal use but I made it publicly available just to keep this repo alive and to help out others who can't access NPS for whatever reason.
