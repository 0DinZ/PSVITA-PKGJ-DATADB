# PSVITA-PKGJ-DATADB
If you have issues with getting the titles from NoPayStation downloaded on PKGJ, then look no further! I have uploaded the entire PS Vita game, update, DLC and PSX game database to github for direct download. This will work straight out of the box with PKGJ!
Note: You must link to the “raw” file in your config.txt, here’s how it looks:

url_games https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex4nder001/PSVITA-PKGJ-DATADB/master/PSV_GAMES.tsv
url_updates https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex4nder001/PSVITA-PKGJ-DATADB/master/PSV_UPDATES.tsv
url_dlcs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex4nder001/PSVITA-PKGJ-DATADB/master/PSV_DLCS.tsv
url_psx_games https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex4nder001/PSVITA-PKGJ-DATADB/master/PSX_GAMES.tsv

Unfortunately this repo probably won't be updated...
